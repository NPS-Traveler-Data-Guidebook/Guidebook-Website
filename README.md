## Cost, Time, and Factors That Could Increase Cost and Time
Feasibility is a key consideration of this Data Guidebook. As such, each case study and technology overview provides a general estimate on the cost and time associated with carrying out that study at a park. The Guidebook uses straightforward bar graphics to communicate the typical amount for each of these. Where applicable, the case studies and technology overview sections will provide further detail on factors that may increase the time and cost of a project.

**Sample of Costs Graphics:**
Low \n ($0 to $5,000) |  Medium \n ($5,000 to $50,000) | High \n ($50,000 to $100,000) | Higher (more than $100,000)
