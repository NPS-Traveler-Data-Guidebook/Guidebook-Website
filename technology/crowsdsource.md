# Crowdsourced Data

This is placeholder text for 2-3 paragraphs about crowdsourced data to describe what it is.

Crowdsourcing can refer to a wide range of activities, typically including technology-centric means such as mobile apps, social media platforms, or location-based services. In some cases, crowdsourced data can also refer any data source generated by the public, including surveys or intersection walk-buttons. For the purposes of this guidebook, crowdsourced data will focus on actively generated data from users using either a mobile app or social media platfrom. 

Mobile apps or websites provide users the opportunity to identify, review, or geo-tag certain aspects of the park while visiting. Each source has specifically tailored information from users and different methods to extract or use the data.
